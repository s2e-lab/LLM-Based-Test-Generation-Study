Here's a possible implementation of the `greatestCommonDivisor` method:

```java
public static int greatestCommonDivisor(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        return a;
    } else {
        return greatestCommonDivisor(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

This is a recursive implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers. The algorithm works by repeatedly taking the remainder of the division of the larger number by the smaller number, until the remainder is zero. At that point, the last non-zero remainder is the greatest common divisor.

The `GreatestCommonDivisorTest` class can now be completed with the following test cases:

```java
class GreatestCommonDivisorTest {

    @Test
    void testGreatestCommonDivisor1() {
        assertEquals(1, GreatestCommonDivisor.greatestCommonDivisor(3, 5));
    }

    @Test
    void testGreatestCommonDivisor2() {
        assertEquals(5, GreatestCommonDivisor.greatestCommonDivisor(25, 15));
    }

    @Test
    void testGreatestCommonDivisor3() {
        assertEquals(1, GreatestCommonDivisor.greatestCommonDivisor(3, 7));
    }

    @Test
    void testGreatestCommonDivisor4() {
        assertEquals(5, GreatestCommonDivisor.greatestCommonDivisor(10, 15));
    }

    @Test
    void testGreatestCommonDivisor5() {
        assertEquals(7, GreatestCommonDivisor.greatestCommonDivisor(49, 14));
    }

    @Test
    void testGreatestCommonDivisor6() {
        assertEquals(12, GreatestCommonDivisor.greatestCommonDivisor(144, 60));
    }

    @Test
    void testGreatestCommonDivisor7() {
        assertEquals(1, GreatestCommonDivisor.greatestCommonDivisor(1, 1));
    }

    @Test
    void testGreatestCommonDivisor8() {
        assertEquals(1, GreatestCommonDivisor.greatestCommonDivisor(1, 7));
    }

    @Test
    void testGreatestCommonDivisor9() {
        assertEquals(7, GreatestCommonDivisor.greatestCommonDivisor(49, 0));
    }

    @Test
    void testGreatestCommonDivisor10() {
        assertEquals(10, GreatestCommonDivisor.greatestCommonDivisor(10, 0));
    }
}
```

These test cases cover various scenarios, including edge cases where one or both inputs are zero or one.
