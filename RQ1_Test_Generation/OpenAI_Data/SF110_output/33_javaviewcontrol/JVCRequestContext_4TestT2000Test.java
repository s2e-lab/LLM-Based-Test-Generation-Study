/**
 * This is the main servlet class for the JVC framework.
 * It is responsible for dispatching requests to the appropriate controller.
 * <p>
 * The controller is the servlet path up to the action.
 * The action is the last part of the servlet path (before any query arguments).
 * <p>
 * The controller is expected to be a class in the package indicated by the
 * 'controllerPackage' init parameter.  The controller class is expected to
 * have a method with the same name as the action.  The method is expected to
 * take a single argument of type JVCRequestContext.
 * <p>
 * The controller method is expected to return a String which is the name of
 * the view to be rendered.  The view is expected to be a jsp file in the
 * directory indicated by the 'viewDir' init parameter.
 * <p>
 * The controller method can also return a Map which is used to pass data to
 * the view.  The map is stored in the request context under the key 'data'.
 * <p>
 * The controller method can also return a non-String value which is used to
 * indicate a non-standard response.  The value can be an Integer which is
 * the http response code to be returned.  The value can also be a String
 * which is the message to be returned.  The value can also be an InputStream
 * which is used to return binary data.
 * <p>
 * The controller method can also throw a NonStandardResponseException which
 * is a subclass of RuntimeException.  The exception can be thrown with an
 * Integer which is the http response code to be returned.  The exception can
 * also be thrown with a String which is the message to be returned.  The
 * exception can also be thrown with an InputStream which is used to return
 * binary data.
 * <p>
 * The controller method can also throw a BinaryResponseException which is a
 * subclass of RuntimeException.  The exception can be thrown with an
 * InputStream which is used to return binary data.
 * <p>
 * The controller method can also throw a RedirectException which is a
 * subclass of RuntimeException.  The exception can be thrown with a String
 * which is the path to redirect to.  If the path starts with a '/' character
 * then its assumed that this is an absolute link and the context path will be
 * prepended to it.
 * <p>
 * The controller method can also throw a ViewException which is a
 * subclass of RuntimeException.  The exception can be thrown with a String
 * which is the name of the view to be rendered.  The view is expected to be
 * a jsp file in the directory indicated by the 'viewDir' init parameter.
 * <p>
 * The controller method can also throw a ViewDataException which is a
 * subclass of RuntimeException.  The exception can be thrown with a Map
 * which is used to pass data to the view.  The map is stored in the request
 * context under the key 'data'.
 * <p>
 * The controller method can also throw a ViewDataException which is a
 * subclass of RuntimeException.  The exception can be thrown with a Map
 * which is used to pass data to the view.  The map is stored in the request
 * context under the key 'data'.
