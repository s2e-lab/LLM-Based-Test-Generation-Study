# Overview

This directory contains the source code from HumanEval that are modified to represent 3 scenarios: 

- Scenario 1: The samples only contain the import statements, function’s signature and implementation.
- Scenario 2: The samples include the function’s signature, implementation and a docstring with the function’s description but excluding the input-output examples. 
- Scenario 3: We use the original sample without excluding anything.
