# Overview

This directory contains the source code from HumanEval that are modified to represent 3 scenarios:

- Scenario 1: The samples only contain the import statements, function’s signature and implementation.
- Scenario 2: The samples include the function’s signature, implementation and a docstring with the function’s
  description but excluding the input-output examples.
- Scenario 3: The samples include the function’s signature, implementation and a docstring with the function’s
  description, and input-output examples, but we exclude its implementation.
- Scenario 4: We use the original sample without excluding anything.

The folder `/tests/` contains JUnit tests we semi-automatically created for these samples.

The file `HumanEval_java_v1.jsonl` is the original JSONL file from the extended HumanEval dataset.
