     * In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
     * and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
     * between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
     * There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
     * If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
     * all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
     * Otherwise, return "NO".
     * For example:
     * exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
     * exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
     * It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
     *
     * > exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4])
     * "YES"
     * > exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4])
     * "NO"
     * > exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 1, 4, 3])
     * "YES"
     * > exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 4])
     * "YES"
     * > exchange([5, 7, 3], [2, 6, 3])
     * "NO"
     * > exchange([3, 2, 6, 1, 8, 9], [3, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1])
     * "NO"
     * > exchange([100, 200], [200, 200])
     * "YES"
