## ID 47
Sample include an incorrect test case:
```
    >>> median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])
    15.0
```
It should be 8, i.e., (10 + 6) / 2.


## ID 116
Includes negative test cases, but they don't work.

## ID 103
    Round to even behavior on the scenario4 python sample. Our implementation should've used rint in Java.
